          Lets talk about entertainment. Entertainment is any activity which
          provides a diversion or permits people to amuse themselves in their
          leisure time, and may also provide fun, enjoyment, and laughter.
          People may create their own entertainment, such as when they
          spontaneously invent a game; participate actively in an activity they
          find entertaining, such as when they play sport as a hobby; or consume
          an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a
          performance. This concept helps humanity lapse in reality and some
          painful existence, I hope you all win your various battles.

          human beings deaing with personal battles. Movies is a work of visual
          art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas,

          MUSIC! Who doesnt relate to it? gosple, hip-hop, afrobeat, blues,
          regea, etc. Everyone, one way or the other get in contact with music
          or musical lines daily. Music is very important to the existence of
          many, I'm developing this application and you can be sure I'm
          listening to one. The availability of music is vast and wide ranging
          from many paid platforms to free platforms and both included ones,
          lets not forget about countless illegal streaming or copyright theft
          website. Just as a piece of advice, pick a playlist today and listen
          to your artist play, "misic is life".
